Talking part:
they keep their old thermostat in the 60s
and even leave the lights and computers on all day
all i can say is waste waste waste
now, my other neighbors they’re as green as grass
check out that solar panel, wind turbine, and even their high tech window glass
you can almost hear the money being saved and the money being made
on a good day, this family can supply their entire home with clean and renewable energy,
making their house a model of energy efficiency.
dont forget the small things that help out either
an LED light bulb here, and a compost pile there
why they could even build another “me” with the amount of materials they’re recycling
so i want you to go ahead
take a look around my neighborhood
and learn what you can do to be green
there’s a lot of ways to conserve energy out there
And I need you to do your part
